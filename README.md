## ZoneMonitor (only for the WoW Vanilla 1.12.1 client)
Monitors the current zone of the player for the arrival and departure of high level players by periodically sending /who requests and and triggers visual and audible alerts. It is intended for spy chars in PvP/Ganking zones like Redridge Mountains to let you know, if high level players arrive in the zone that might come after you. The level threshold for alerts is 32 by default and configurable in the code of the AddOn.
